# Learning Python

Python is a great programming language. Here's a list of things I've been doing to learn Python.

- [Piedra, Papel y Tijera (Rock, Papers and Scissors)](https://github.com/franciscogo/piedra-papel-tijera) 
	The classic Rock, Papers and Scissors game.
- [Lol Surrender](https://github.com/franciscogo/lolsurrender)
	Little script that emulates the League of Legends Surrender option
